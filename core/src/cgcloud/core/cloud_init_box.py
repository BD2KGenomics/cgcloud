        # Lucid's and Oneiric's cloud-init mount ephemeral storage on /mnt instead of
        # /mnt/ephemeral, Fedora doesn't mount it at all. To keep it consistent across
        # releases and platforms we should be explicit.
        #
        # Also note that Lucid's mountall waits on the disk device. On t1.micro instances this
        # doesn't show up causing Lucid to hang on boot on this type. The cleanest way to handle
        # this is to remove the ephemeral entry on t1.micro instances by specififying [
        # 'ephemeral0', None ]. Unfortunately, there is a bug [1] in cloud-init that causes the
        # removal of the entry to be ineffective. The "nobootwait" option might be a workaround
        # but Fedora stopped supporting it such that now only Ubuntu supports it. A better
        # workaround is to always have the ephemeral entry in fstab, even on micro instances,
        # but to exclude the 'auto' option such that when cloud-init runs 'mount -a', it will not
        # get mounted. We can then mount the filesystem explicitly, except on micro instances.
        #
        # The important thing to keep in mind is that when booting instance B from an image
        # created on a instance A, the fstab from A will be used by B before cloud-init can make
        # its changes to fstab. This behavior is a major cause of problems and the reason why
        # micro instances tend to freeze when booting from images created on non-micro instances
        # since their fstab initially refers to an ephemeral volume that doesn't exist. The
        # nobootwait and nofail flags are really just attempts at working around this issue.
